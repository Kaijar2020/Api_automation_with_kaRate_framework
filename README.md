 API automation with karate framework

 # What is Karate?

 Karate Framework can be used for testing different layers of application development. The framework can be used for test automation of Desktop/Browser based apps, Performance testing, and API Testing. Most of the API testing tools require some kind of programming expertise, Karate on the other hand does not require programming knowledge and can be used by business users and analysts.

 # What is API?
 APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.

 #### Project Details
 Performed API testing with REST API. Complete full END-to-END testing. All HTTPS requests and responses also validate the test data. API was taken from Go REST (https://gorest.co.in/). Here used Karate Framework to Automate the API and generated the BDD report by helping on  cucumber java.
